## Domain Model - Building a resource of domains to describe concepts for the Punjabi language <h2>

* This is an effort of building a resource of domains that could be used to describe concepts for the Punjabi language. 
We are trying to assign concepts hierarchically by starting assigning concepts as top-level domains and then conceptualizing lower-level domains 
having more granular conceptualization under these top-level domains. 
This approach could be used to support multiple applications in the NLP of the Punjabi language.
