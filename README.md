# PunjabiTechno Club <h1>
  
I, **Harjap Gosal** with the help of my technology-oriented friends in school have started a **PunjabiTechno club** that focuses on the *technical development of the Punjabi language, and this GitHub repository is dedicated to the development, harmonization, and sharing of multiple knowledge resources, diverse methodologies, and a variety of tools with the aim of understanding, extraction, and retrieval from unstructured Punjabi language text. This work falls under the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables machines to understand and process the human language.*

Our current focus is on building resources for the **technical development of the Punjabi language in Gurmukhi Script.**
The Punjabi language is written in two scripts, namely Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi. Gurmukhi script is the script used for writing Punjabi, mostly in East Punjab. Punjabi is most commonly written in the Gurmukhi script. Gurmukhi script is considered to be a complete and accurate way to represent Punjabi sounds, and it follows a ‘one sound-one symbol’ principle [1]. Shahmukhi script is the way of writing the Punjabi language in the Persian script and followed mostly in western Punjab.

There are efforts by many researchers, groups, and organizations to work on the different aspects of Punjabi language processing. But like other Indian languages, a lot of work remains to be done in the field of Punjabi language processing.

The tasks currently undertaken by the club are:
* Domain Model - Building a resource of domains to describe concepts for the Punjabi language
* Building a Punjabi SentiWordNet (Resource for Opinionated words)
